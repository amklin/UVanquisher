    <div class="collapsible-header">My UV sensor isn't working properly. What am I doing wrong?</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>The most common source of issue with new users is improper orientation of the
        wearable sensor. Make sure that the UV sensor can make direct contact with the sunlight for the best and most
        accurate results.</span></div>

    <div class="collapsible-header">What is UV radiation?</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>UV radiation is a form of energy emitted by the sun, coming in three types, UVA,
        UVB, and UVC, that differ in energy levels. Because the UVC and UVB are mostly absorbed by the ozone layer, UVA
        is the most prevalent to our daily lives. UV radiation is known to damage DNA in the body's cells, primarily
        skin cells. For more information, click <a

    <div class="collapsible-header">Why is UV radiation dangerous?</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Extended exposure to UV radiation can lead to an abundance of health issues.
        Obviously, it can cause skin-related issues, including premature aging, wrinkles, sunburn, actinic keratosis,
        and solar elastosis. Most notoriously, UV radiation is known to cause skin cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="collapsible-header">What do the numbers mean?</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>As stated by the EPA, the UV index scale is divided into 5 exposure categories:
        low, moderate, high, very high, and extreme. Low exposure (&#60;2) means that being outside in the sunlight is
        very safe. Moderate exposure (3-5) means that being outside in the sunlight is still relatively safe, but you
        should take precautions like wearing a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. High exposure (6-7) means that protection
        against exposure is needed. Very high and extreme exposure (8-11 & 11+) are very similar in the way that being
        outside during the day is incredibly dangerous and should be avoided if possible, even with adequate
        protection.</span>

    <div class="collapsible-header">What is skin cancer?</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Skin cancer is characterized by abnormal growth of skin cells. Generally, this
        will occur in places that are most often exposed to UV radiation, but it can also appear in other places. For
        more information on skin cancer, click <a

  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header">When am I at risk for skin cancer?</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Cumulative and extensive sun exposure at high UV levels raise your risk of
        developing skin cancer drastically. Furthermore, people with fair complexions are often at an even greater risk
        for skin cancer. When reading your logged data, you should aim to reduce exposure.</span></div>
